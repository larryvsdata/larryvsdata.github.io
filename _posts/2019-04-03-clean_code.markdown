Fundamentals of clean code are boring textbook knowledge albeit inevitable. Let me restate what is already or should be known:

1) Make a top-down design! Write up all classes, methods, variables and tests.
2) Pick a design pattern if you need to. This is more for Java projects.
3) Pick a methodology. Generally, it is spiral or waterfall.
4) Write test cases before implementation of methods. Yes, it is redundant and dull sometimes.
5) Limit every method to 3 lines at most. You heard me. Break larger methods into smaller ones. 
6) Comments up! Comment every method you write. Don't be brief. Write up a whole paragraph. When you leave, someone else should be able to pick up where you left. That individual could be you after a couple of years. Mark my words.
7) Check scalability. They should be all linear or logarithmic. If not, why not? Can there be a better way? Can you use some heuristics? Make an effort.
8) Make sure all tests pass.
9) Version your project. Better the code at each version.

These are some guidelines for the curious. You may add more items obviously.

Life is short, let's code.
