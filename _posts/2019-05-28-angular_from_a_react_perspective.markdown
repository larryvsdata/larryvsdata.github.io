There is a higher demand for Angular in the job market. That is why I started learning it as a front-end tool recently.

React is much simpler, more clear and easier to debug in my opinion.

Angular 7 I am working on is a descendant of Angular 2. Some history: Second version of Angular diverged into two as Angular JS and Angular 2. Angular 2-7 are all lineal. I started Angular 7, albeit Angular 6 is similar.

As for the technical part, Angular enable passing information two ways: Top to bottom and from bottom up. This may be handy but also prone to error. I sensed more Javascript object oriented structure in Angular as compared to React. In addition to CSS stylization, you can also define components to style components as well. Interesting feature.

Let me work on it and write more about it.

Life is short, let's code.
