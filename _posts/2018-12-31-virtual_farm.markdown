Do you want to be a farmer virtually?
This project implements a virtual business where you can have virtual farms and animals. With your total cash, you may buy virtual farms with various animals in them. You can set co-owners to your farm, i.e in order to share your overhead etc.
Nice. The admin may add new farms to the database and delete farms off the db , too. Same logic goes for animals.

The main idea is that with a fancy interface and the usage of bitcoin, you may connect a real business to web and enable people to invest there. Profit etc. may be shared and the bitcoin can anonymize the whole business.
