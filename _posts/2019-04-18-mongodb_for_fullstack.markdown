As Fullstack developers, we stick to SQL databases just because they are standard and they do a good job. Due to object relational mapping, we usually don't know every single action happening in the background. THose actions are totally encapsulated. I assure you ActiveRecord or whatever other library you use, is joining tables , executing subqueries etc. in the background. As your models and respective tables get more populated, those become more taxing and time consuming.

What did smart software engineers come up with? A NoSQL database, MongoDB.

MongoDB is the most widely used database right now. Personally, I like it since it has our "Hash" architecture. Everything is in JSON format. Isn't that cool? Deploy your hash in Ruby, object in Js, dictionary in Python directly brother. Saves time. At least, from a coding perspective.

It utilizes a sharding scheme to make the database more effective. I don't want to go more into that because it is more DB design and data engineering. Hadoop based systems use and has to use sharding. Otherwise, queries become slow.

Anyways, give MongoDB a shot. Use RoboMango for starters.

Life is short, let's code.
