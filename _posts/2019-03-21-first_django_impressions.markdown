Having excelled in Rails, I started finally looking into other platforms. Obviously, I am at a senior level when it comes to Python. Hence, some Python based backend would be my first choice. Namely, Django or Flask.

I tried Flask before and it is a bit conservative. I will definitely come back to it but right now Django is a more desirable option in terms of market demand.

At first, you may fall into the trap of likening Rails-Sinatra pair to Django-Flask. It is inaccurate. However, Python based platforms are like Ruby based ones: They are slow.

For the curious, let me summarize some views of minee:

-Python syntax and logic are similar to Ruby's. Even if you are starting from scratch, you will pick up the grammar. Pay attention to the indentation, though.

- Same MVC structure applies. Django developer also use the funny acronym MTV, standing for model-template-view. It is nothing surprising.

- In Python, libraries are imported instead of gems being included. Pretty similar. One abrupt difference is that a virtual environment is defined instead of Gemfile being bundled. This way, different versions of libraries may be used for different projects. Each time a different virtual environment is activated instead of reinstalling everything all over globally.

-For simple projects, stick to Sqlite. Don't overcomplicate things for yourself.

I will post some updates later on.

Life is short, let's code.
