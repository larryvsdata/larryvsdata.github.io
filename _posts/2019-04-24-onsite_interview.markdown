Yes, this is your last stop. Probably, a pass or fail kind of test. 
I have had a couple of these and this week I am having another. Hopefully, the very last one.
I want to touch upon some basics about the onsite interview for those newbies:

-Ask questions before you go. What are you supposed to do? Get the itenerary and plan accordingly.
-Sometimes you have to make a presentation. The bad thing is it is mentioned in the last minute. A strategy would be to have a presentation at the ready and make adjustments for each company.
-Study, study, study. If you have coding tests, practice leetcode etc. Get prepared.
-Interviewers rarely ask random questions. People ask questions related to their backgroung and the job. Think ahead and acquire knowledge.
- Make sure you have your soft skills. Those are sometimes tested. Especially, at lunch. Big companies would rarely hire wierdos. Don't act like one.
- I am not the type that would haggle a deal. If you are willing to bargain, at least be versed with the range. The range differs from company to company and is heavily dependant on the location. If you overshoot, sorry but that is not smart.

Life is short, let's code.
