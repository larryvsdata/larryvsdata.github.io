Compatibility issues are a headache when it comes to intalling and running software. Different software need different OS to run smoothly. Reinstalling and updating software over and over again is a waste of time.

Docker is an environment that enables downloading images of various programs and enables smooth running of them. For example, elasticsearch cannot run on Windows, but on Docker you can definitely download its image and run it.

On terminal you can install software and  run its commands. Then you can delete those images when mo longer needed.

Let me experiment more with Docker and report back here.

Life is short, let's code.
