What you can encounter during interviews in addition to algorithmic and data structure related questions is design questions. Design questions arise more generally when applying to more dedicated and hardcore software development companies.

With that being said, design and pseudo code or real code should be implemented in any programming languages like thos algorithm questions. Well, not really. In my experience, design questions are a lot Java oriented. There is even a concept called "Design Patterns" and those patterns are for Java. You have to learn those 30+ patterns if you want to become a dedicated Java software engineer. Bottomline: Learn Java

In general, a design question is about an application you use everyday. Some ideas: Facebook frontpage and personal pages, simplifies Instagram, Fedex service... Just look around and write pseudocodes and attempt to utilize Java Design patterns. Some of this is your own imagination and bro science.

Life is short, let's code.
