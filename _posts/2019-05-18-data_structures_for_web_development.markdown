Data structures are essential for pretty much every sort of code development. Web developers use data structures frequently. Albeit they use some structures more frequently than others. Let's have a quick look at them to have a general  idea:

Frequently Used Ones:

-Lists: They are a staple.
-Hashtables: We explained them earlier in more detail. They come in handy as they require constant time.

Moderately Used Ones:

-Linked Lists: Social network based graphs can be considered as linked lists. Linkedin and Facebbok can be some example sites.

-Hashsets: They also scale in constant time.

-Stacks & Queues: They are good buffers for intermediate data storage.

Rare Ones:

-Binary Search Trees: Logarithmic time. Very rare.
- Heaps: Min and max values can be retrieved in constant time.

Never:
-AVL Trees: I have not seen one single person using these.
