On my part, it is the cloud service or the cloud deployment.

We used rails, then  javascript and then React.js. We hosted our sites on local. Then on Hereoku. Those are endeavors of an individual. On an enterprise level, wesites have to hosted globally and must be catered to sometimes millions of users. Websites should be nimble on their feet.

With that being said, cloud is the best and most scalable solution to everything.

Three options you have in terms of cloud: MS Azure, Amazon web Services and Google Cloud.

Personal advise: AWS is ubiquitous and more demanded. Get you hands dirty on it.

For me, I need to use Azure as of right now. I go the documentation. May post updates here later.

Life is short, let's code.
