For software engineers, after the prescreening part comes the coding test. It may be a part of the general technical interview. Generally, it is carried out on an online coding environment. If unprepared, it is generally formidable to get through if not impossible. Let me touch upon my personal approach to prepare for the test:

- Brush up on data structures. If unversed, learn data structures. Some are more important than others. Without linked list or BSTs, your chances would be slim.
- 
- Algorithms, too. Sorting and searching are commonly asked ones. Don't shrug and look down on them. There are more than 10 sorting  algorithms. Knowledge is bliss.

- Get a leetcode account. Don't be stingy. There are other websites but not as competent.
 
 Start with easy questions and solve a whole bunch of them.
 
 Be consistent. Solve a few questions everyday. You will get the feel of it.
 
 As you get comfortable, switch to questions of medium difficulty. Rarely, somebody will ask you a "hard" question. Those take a solid hour to code.
 
 Use an IDE to check your syntax and for trial and error. Many people are against using the IDE but I personally find it useful.
 
 - During the interview, choose an appropriate coding language. For example, if you haven't coded recursion in Ruby, don't attempt it for the first time in your test. Switch to whatever you are comforatble with, i.e Python, JS...
 
-Learn big O notation and timing. That is a staple.

-For more demanding jobs, learn memory management. In high level languages, memory issues are sometimes neglected.

Life is short, let's code.
